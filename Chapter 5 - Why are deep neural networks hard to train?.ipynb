    "In theory, neural networks with only one hidden layer are capable of approximating any continuous function. In practice, this can require a huge number of hidden neurons, making the network inefficient. This is very similar to the universality of $NAND$ or $XOR$ gates: though they are sufficient to represent any logical formula up to equivalence, they lead to formulae so long that they are not amenable to practical applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nielsen gives an [example](https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il//report/2012/137/) of such inefficiencies. True, we were able to surpass $98$% accuracy on $MNIST$ with just one hidden layer. However, this did take some work (*cf* [Chapter 3](http://localhost:8888/notebooks/Desktop/Python%20Tutorials/NNDL/Chapter%203.1%20-%20Improving%20the%20way%20neural%20networks%20learn.ipynb)), and it seems pretty plausible that deeper networks could be more powerful, in particular because they could encode a hierarchical structure, with layers encoding more abstract concepts as they get nearer to the output layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we shall see, training deeper networks is harder than just applying the vanilla $SGD$+Backpropagation method we implemented in the previous chapters. In particular, the speed of learning is unevenly distributed between layers. It will often be the case that we will find ourselves in either one of the two following situations:\n",

    "In the previous example, adding identical hidden layers doesn't always improve, and can even decrease network accuracy ! This is very counter-intuitive: surely adding layers can't hurt ? After all, they make the network more powerful (without impeding regularization), right ? So what's going here ?\n",

    "If we take a look at the partial derivatives $\\frac {\\partial C} {\\partial b}$ of the cost with respect to the bias of each neuron (which, by **(BP3)**, are also equal to the rate of change of $C$ with respect to the weighted input), we observe a striking discrepancy. For a network with $2$ hidden layers, the absolute values of the partial derivatives at the start of learning is much greater in later neurons than in early neurons.\n",

    "Michael calls **gradient** of the $j^{th}$ neuron of the $l^{th}$ layer what we previously referred to as the error, $\\delta^l_j = \\frac {\\partial C} {\\partial b^l_j}$. The norm $||\\delta^l||$ measures the speed at which the $l^{th}$ layer is learning. In our $2$ layer example, $||\\delta^1||$ is much smaller than $||\\delta^2||$. This patern holds when we increase the number of hidden layers, and when we measure $||\\delta^l||$ at different dates during learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoiding the vanishing problem leads to fall into the opposite extreme: the **exploding gradient problem**, where earlier gradients are much bigger (in absolute value) then later gradients. This general problem is what we call the network's **instability**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Maybe a vanishing gradient is what we want: after all, isn't it a necessary condition for the minimum of a differentiable function that it's gradient vanish ? Maybe the gradient's small values correspond to the network's having converged ? Unfortunately, we know this not to be the case: a vanishing gradient is far from sufficient for minimization problems, and it's pretty easy to see that the vanishing gradient problem impedes efficient learning in deep neural nets.\n",

    "The main takeaway here is that $|\\sigma'(x)| \\leq 0.25$ for any $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Training begins with weights set according to a normal distribution with standard error $\\frac 1 {\\sqrt{n_{in}}} \\leq 1$. Therefore, at least at the start, all the $|w_j \\times \\sigma'(z_j)|$ will tend to be smaller than $1$, so that the gradients exponentially decay as we consider earlier layers, hence the **vanishing gradient problem**."

    "The deeper problem isn't vanishing or explosion: it's **instability**, which can be traced to the formula for the gradient, which involves a product of terms from each layer.For learning to happen in a more regular fashion, the products need to balanec out in some way. \n",
    "\n",
    "In particular (exercise), if $\\sigma$ was such that $\\sigma'$ could reach bigger values then $0.25$, this could help against vanishing, but it would make explosion more probable, and therefore wouldn't solve instability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is the vanishing gradient problem more common then the exploding gradient problem ?\n",
    "Another way of formulating this question is: why is $|w \\times \\sigma'(z)|\\leq 1$ more common then $|w \\times \\sigma'(z)| \\geq 1$ ?\n",
    "\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore increasing $w$ doesn't necessarily increase $|w \\times \\sigma'(z)|\\leq 1$: it's hard to get big values of  $|w \\times \\sigma'(z)|$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's do this again, except more rigorously this time (exercise):\n",
    "* because $\\sigma'(x) \\leq 0.25$ for every $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, if $|w \\times \\sigma'(z)| \\geq 1$ then necessarily $|w| \\geq 4$\n",
    "* it's easy to see that the measure of the set of input activations for which $|w\\cdot \\sigma'(wa+b)|≥1$ is maximal for $b = 0$\n",
    "\n",
    "So consider for every $w \\in ] -\\infty, -4] \\cup [4, + \\infty[$  the function $$g_w : a \\in ] 0, 1[  \\mapsto |w\\cdot \\sigma'(wa)|$$\n",

First, we separate cases according to the sign of $w$. multiplying by the denominator and factoring leads to solving quadratic inequalities in $X := e^{-\\frac 1 2 wa}$.
