    "## 2. $L^2$ regularization\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw previously, overfitting is what happens when variance is too big. Regularization is a way to solve this issue without impeding the network's power too much: the idea is to penalize model complexity by modifying the cost function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We therefore introduce the following cost:\n",
    "$$C = C_0 + \\frac {\\lambda} {2n} \\sum_w w^2$$\n",
    "where $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}+$ is called the **regularization parameter**, and $C_0$ is a non-regularized cost function. For instance if $C_0$ is the cross entropy cost function:\n",
    "$$C = - \\frac {1} {n} \\sum_x yln(a) + (1-y)ln(1-a) + \\frac {\\lambda} {2n} \\sum_w w^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "And when $C_0$ is the quadratic cost function:\n",
    "$$C = - \\frac {1} {n} \\sum_x ||y(x)-a||^2 + \\frac {\\lambda} {2n} \\sum_w w^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\lambda$ represents whether we are more concerned with bias or variance. Notice that we haven't yet shown how exactly penalizing big weights is tantamount to avoiding excessive model complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regularization doesn't make gradient descent much more complicated: the rate of change of $C_0$ with respect to the weights and biases can be computed using backpropagation, and the gradient is given by $\\frac {\\partial C} {\\partial w} = \\frac {\\partial C_0} {\\partial w} + \\frac {\\lambda w} {n}$ and $\\frac {\\partial C} {\\partial b} = \\frac {\\partial C_0} {\\partial b}$. Stochastic gradient descent also happens naturally (for weights, approximate the gradient of $C_0$ and then add the $\\frac {\\lambda w} {n}$ term, for biases, regularization doen't change anything).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Testing $L^2$ regularization\n",
    "Let's test these changes on the neural network that we used in the previous part to showcase the ills of overfitting. As often, this code is Michael Nielsen's."
