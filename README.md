# Neural-Networks-and-Deep-Learning
Notes, code and exercises from Michael Nielsen's great online book.
You will find:
* My summaries of the different chapters, sometimes in my own words, sometimes in Nielsenâs.
* Solution to exercises from the book
* Code I copy-pasted from the book
* Code I programmed myself, but that is also in the book

Writing these notebooks was very useful for me. Whether they will be useful for you is more uncertain. If you want to learn more about neural networks and deep learning, I strongly advise you to read the book itself !
