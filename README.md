# Neural-Networks-and-Deep-Learning
Notes, code and exercises from Michael Nielsen's great online book.
You will find:
* My summaries and reformulations of the different chapters
* Solution to exercises from the book
* Code I copy-pasted from the book
* Code that I programmed myself, but that is also in the book

Writing these notebooks was very useful for me. Whether you will find them useful is more uncertain. If you want to learn more about neural networks and deep learning, I strongly advise you to read the book itself !

The pictures are screenshots from the book that I included in my summary.
